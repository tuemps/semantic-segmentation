# TUe MPS Semantic Segmentation
Robust Semantic Segmentation with CNNs trained on multiple datasets.

Currently you can find our system on this link: [https://github.com/tuemps/IV2018-hierarchical-semantic-segmentation-for-heterogeneous-datasets](https://github.com/tuemps/IV2018-hierarchical-semantic-segmentation-for-heterogeneous-datasets).

In the future the system will be able to recognize more classes and perform also related tasks to semantic segmentation.
